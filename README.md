### Statement
You have to develop an application simulating the reservation of bicycles (Bicloo) in Nantes (France). These bikes are distributed in
many stations in the city. The user must be able to book one from his browser (provided that he bikes are still available at the station !). 
The reservation will be temporarily saved on the visitor's browser.
You will develop the application entirely in JavaScript by displaying a map using the GoogleMaps API with the list of bike rental stations available in the city of Nantes.
The JavaScript code must be entirely designed in object-oriented programming.

### For this project I used:

- Object oriented JavaScript
- ES5 and ES6
- AJAX
- Using the GoogleMaps API, JCDecaux API, HTML5 Canvas API, WebStorage API
